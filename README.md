# Retail Store RFM Analysis

## Background Context

### Overview
A retail store focused on selling goods to customers. The business team realizes that the business has grown, but they do not yet understand customer characteristics. The business team wants to understand customer patterns and characteristics, their value, and how to approach them.

The goal is to increase the number of loyal/repeat customers and attract new customers. The business team wants to determine the best way to achieve this based on customer purchasing behavior and to develop new strategies to attract more new customers. Therefore, a thematic campaign using the RFM method is needed.

## Problem Statement and Objectives

- Segment customers using the RFM method.
- Identify the best products for each customer segment.
- Develop the best treatment strategies for each customer segment.
